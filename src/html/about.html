			Dunkin’ Donuts Lebanon was the first to introduce donuts and filtered coffee to the Lebanese society. According to a survey conducted by PARC (Pan Arab Research Center), Dunkin’ Donuts Lebanon has proved to be the top coffee shop and hang out place for people of most age groups for 3 consecutive years. In addition DD visitors have registered the highest loyalty out of all the coffee shops in Lebanon with more than 50% of its customers visiting it most often. For more than a decade, Dunkin’ Donuts Lebanon has become the prime destination for coffee and donut lovers!

				It was in 1998 that Dunkin’ Donuts opened its first branch in Lebanon on Zalka highway. Over a decade later, the Lebanese community’s favorite coffee shop now has 30 branches all over the country! We have expanded in the greater Beirut area, with a branch in Hamra Main Street that was opened in the presence of the president and CEO of Dunkin’ Donuts worldwide. Our most recent addition includes a branch in St Nicolas, Ashrafieh.
